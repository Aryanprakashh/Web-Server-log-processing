# Log Analysis Using Machine Learning And Hadoop

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze log data using machine learning techniques and Hadoop for distributed processing. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from large volumes of log data.

## Features
- Log data preprocessing
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Distributed data processing using Hadoop
- Visualization of analysis results

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Log-Analysis-Using-Machine-Learning-And-Hadoop.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Log-Analysis-Using-Machine-Learning-And-Hadoop/Project_Files
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ``
    
## Usage
1. Preprocess the log data:
    ```sh
    python preprocess_logs.py
    ```
2. Train the machine learning model:
    ```sh
    python train_model.py
    ```
3. Run the Hadoop job:
    ```sh
    hadoop jar your_hadoop_job.jar input_path output_path
    ```
4. Visualize the results:
    ```sh
    python visualize_results.py
    ```
